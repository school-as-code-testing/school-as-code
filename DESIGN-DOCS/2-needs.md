# Needs

To make a study group successful there are several concerns that need to be taking into account. Some concerns are only relevant to larger groups, but pretty much everything a smaller group needs a larger group will need as well. it's like layers of an onion:

## 1. an independent learner

An independent learner will need to:

- define a course's path through selected topics/materials
- track progress in an easy and professionally-relevant way
- have a place for notes and helpful references
- have a way to showcase what they can do for potential collaborators or employers
- all of these things should be 1 click away from some sort of home page

## 2. more than 1 learners studying together

A group of learners will need everything an independent learner needs plus ...

- all those things need to be shared and collaboration-friendly
- a way to keep track of who is in the study group (names, faces, about-me's)
- a centralized way to track individual _and_ group progress through the materials
- a q/a discussion forum

## 3. a group of learners with teacher support

A group of learners with support from some teachers will need everything above plus ...

- a one-click-away home page for coaches
