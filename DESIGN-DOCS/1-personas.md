# Personas

> these are the ideal long-term personas, for more pragmatic short-term personas see _Scoping and Timeline_

In the world of [free-range learning](https://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#g:free-range-learner) you not only have many personas, but also different roles each persona can play at different times. It's helpful to think of _hats_ not _titles_. Some common hats include:

- **learner**: you are studying to learn a new skill.
- **peer learners**: you are learning something together and have something to offer each other
- **peer leader**: you are not an expert, but know enough more than the others to take the lead in a group of peer learners
- **[end-user teacher](https://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#g:end-user-teacher)**: you have solid content knowledge and can guide learners, but do not have much experience teaching the topic
- **content curator**: you are curating or creating the materials others will study
- **facilitator**: you may or may not have knowledge of the content, but are responsible for coordinating the learner's experience (scheduling, logistics, mediation, ...)
- **accountant**: small and/or informal organizations often have tight funding, it's best to be strict open and fair about how it is used
- ... many more but this is enough to get the idea for now

A single person may wear the hat of "teacher" one day and "learner" the next, or "facilitator" today and "content curator" next month.

With that in mind, let's try to define our target personas and the different hats they might wear:

## Human Personas

what types of people might use this thing we're making?

### Margaret

They are an accountant with lots of experience using spreadsheets, they recently discovered that Python exists and see how it could be useful. They found a local meetup of Python learners and now attends twice a month. These are their hats:

- When practicing conventional coding challenges they are a _learner_. Compared to Margaret many meetup participants come from different programming languages so learning Python is more about "translating" the solutions they could write in their old language rather than learning algorithmic problem solving. Margaret gets a lot of help from them
- When practicing mathematical coding challenges Margaret is a _peer leader_, the math comes easy so they can guide others through how to solve the challenge
- each member of the organization brings 5$ for milk and cookies, Margaret has offered to be the group's _accountant_ (of course)

### Make more these

## Group Personas

what types of groups might use this thing we're making?

### A single learner

this person is studying alone on weekends and needs a way to organize their study.

### A group of learners

these people are studying together on evenings and needs a light-weight solution to share their progress and learning

### A group of learners with teachers

these people are learning together with the occasional support of experienced developers

### A centrally organized group

this group of learners is facilitated by some organization like a library, a school or ... something. the organization provides space to learn, coordinates the schedules, and follows up with each learner as much as they can.

this central organizer may or may not have access to teachers, if they do they are also responsible for coordinating when who will teach what and which learners need more 1-1 support.

### Multiple centrally organized groups

these groups of learners are facilitated by a central organization, each group of learners may be studying the same material in different cohorts, or following different courses. either way the solutions for coordinating all the groups' learning should be consistent and centralized.

this central organizer may or may not have access to teachers, if they do they are also responsible for coordinating when who will teach what and which learners need more 1-1 support.

### Official Institutions

This probably isn't for you. There is no "backend" for managing the levels of access and administration you need, this thing is geared towards more informal learning.
