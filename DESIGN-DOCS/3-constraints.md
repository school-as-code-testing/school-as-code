# Constraints

> very WIP

- the skills necessary to set up this system must be the same skills required to use the system
  - This is an idealist long-term constraint, for a more pragmatic short-term constraint see the _Scoping and Timeline_.
- the system must simulate professional workflows so that learners implicitly learn the "water" of development, and do not need to learn two ways of doing: one to complete the course and another to work on projects in the wild
- the system should primarily be a _way of doing things_, not something that does things for you. (after setup, the initial setup can be automated)
- the system must be content-agnostic, you should be able to use it to organize your studying of any existing materials
- you should be able to translate these ways of doing to different platforms (avoid platform-lock)
- this system should be equally helpful for a 1+ day workshop as for a month+ curriculum.
